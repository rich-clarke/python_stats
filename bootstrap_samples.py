Visualizing bootstrap samples
In this exercise, you will generate bootstrap samples from the set of annual
 rainfall data measured at the Sheffield Weather Station in the UK from 1883 to 2015. 
 The data are stored in the NumPy array rainfall in units of millimeters (mm). By graphically 
 displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF, you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling 
 allows probabilistic descriptions of data.
